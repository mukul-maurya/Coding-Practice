Handling Vectors
-----------------

Declare 
  vector<int> v; //  Declare an empty array pof ints
  vector<int> b (5, 10);       // five ints with value 10
  vector<int> c (b.begin(),b.end());  // iterating through second
  vector<int> d (c);  // copy of c
  
 
v.begin()
v.end()  // can be use in loops


Member functions in vector are

Some of the member functions of vectors are:
at(): Returns the reference to the element at a particular position (can also be done using ‘[ ]’ operator). Its time complexity is O(1).
back(): Returns the reference to the last element. Its time complexity is O(1).
begin(): Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
clear(): Deletes all the elements from the vector and assign an empty vector. Its time complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the vector.
empty(): Returns a boolean value, true if the vector is empty and false if the vector is not empty. Its time complexity is O(1).
end(): Returns an iterator pointing to a position which is next to the last element of the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
erase(): Deletes a single element or a range of elements. Its time complexity is O(N + M) where N is the number of the elements erased and M is the number of the elements moved.
front(): Returns the reference to the first element. Its time complexity is O(1).
insert(): Inserts new elements into the vector at a particular position. ts time complexity is O(N + M) where N is the number of elements inserted and M is the number of the elements moved .
pop_back(): Removes the last element from the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
push_back(): Inserts a new element at the end of the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).
resize(): Resizes the vector to the new length which can be less than or greater than the current length. Its time complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the resized vector.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the vector. Its time complexity is O(1).


Sorting a vector--
  sort(v.begin(), v.end())
  sort (v.begin(), v.end(), greater<int>()) // To sort in descending order.

Calculating power
  in C math.h required
    pow(x,y);
  in c++ bits/stdc++ is enough
    pow(x,y);
